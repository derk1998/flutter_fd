This is a split off from P2P Copy Paste which contain the generic files that could be used in other apps.

## Features

* Flows: structure (parts of your) application in state machines.
* MVVM: layer your application easily with the various MVVM classes in this package.
* Subscriptions: easily handle subscriptions without fearing to forget to close streams, stream controllers or stream subscriptions.
* Wrapper around the navigator: easily test your apps with the NavigationManager.

## Getting started

For now this package is intended for my own use so documentation is lacking. The goal is to slowly mature this package and one day publish it to pub.dev as well.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
